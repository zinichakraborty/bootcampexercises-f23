## Submission
See the submission instructions down below. 
- **Due Date**: 10-12-2023

## Instructions
Congrats on making it your first bootcamp React project!
To create your React app go to the exer5 folder in CommandLine or Terminal and run npx create-react-app marta-interface. After it finishes installing dependencies, go ahead and do cd marta-interface; you are now in your React app!

To view your code, run npm start in CommandLine or Terminal in that folder. Right now you should be seeing a bunch of stuff that React has naturally displayed whenever you initialize a React app. You can ignore everything except index.js and App.js. The index.js file is what you are actually seeing when you run npm start, and there is only an App component being displayed. The code for what the App component displays is in App.js. In App.js you will write all your frontend code. You can also make a file called script.js inside src.

**Requirements:**
- Only work on App.js and script.js files
- In script.js call the MARTA API.
