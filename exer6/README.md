## Instructions

Simple instructions: We are improving our Marta Interface from Exercise 5!

To begin, please move a copy of your React app folder from Exercise 5 into Exercise 6.

You will need to initialize the React app again as it is not recognized as one after movement, to do this run `npm i` after you `cd` into your folder. Then, run `npm start` in the command line or terminal in that folder to see the app display.

We are going to incorporate useState to render the page based on each train line. Currently, we hardcode the line's state, but we want the user to be able to move through lines on the interface. We do this by adding four buttons that will change state when clicked.

First, import useState by adding `import React, { useState } from 'react';` to the top of `LinesPage.js` and inside the function, but above the return add state for line and for the buttons that list the timing and directions of the train, so that the current states are `useState("gold")` and `useState(["Arriving", "Scheduled", "Northbound", "Southbound"])`. Now, inside the return, we will add four buttons before the TrainList component, and title them each by the line colors. OnClick for each of these buttons should set the state of the line to the color of the title of the button and set the buttons array to match the directions of the line. For example, the green line should have `setButtons(["Arriving", "Scheduled", "Eastbound", "Westbound"])`. Both the line and button states should be added as props to the TrainList component and when a line's button is clicked, the only trains that should be displayed are from that line.

We are no longer using static data! Instead, we are calling this URL: http://13.59.196.129:3001/. You can get the filtered trains for each line using this link by adding http://13.59.196.129:3001/arrivals/[line]; for example, to get the trains from the gold line, call http://13.59.196.129:3001/arrivals/gold. 

*Important note:* Previously, we learned how to call from an API using fetch(); however, React can have issues with rendering using fetch as if the called data has not arrived yet but is being asked to be displayed there will be an issue. To handle this we will incorporate useEffect()! We will have two more states added to LinesPage.js: loading and data, currently set to true and null. Then, we will add useEffect() below like so (where the line in the URL is a variable that changes based on the current state of the line from the line buttons):

```
//ADD MORE CODE TO ACCOUNT FOR LOADING
useEffect(() => {
        fetch("[URL]")
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => setData(data))
      },[])
```

Our navbar is now going to be operational! Make it so that when you click on a station in the navbar, it will become highlighted, and the trains displayed are filtered to display only those currently approaching that station, so for Doraville, we only want trains with `{"STATION": "DORAVILLE"}`.

We are going to make the buttons we created before operational. When a button is clicked it will filter the trains by the filter titled on the button. When a button is 'on', if it is clicked again the filter will go away. More than one button can be used to filter the data at a time, so make it identifiable that a button is currently "on" (you could do this by making the button color faded if it is on).

As a fun bonus, once the rest of the code displays successfully, you can incorporate condition rendering using useEffect() so that if the filters used on the trainlist result in an empty list of trains, then display something else to notify the user that there are no trains rather than just display an empty page. For example, you could add a "No Current Trains Match Filters" header.

**Requirements:**
- Call the MARTA API by fetching from the link provided: http://13.59.196.129:3001/
- Incorporate state buttons to display trains based on each line color (gold, red, green blue)
- Make the navbar functional so that the trains are filtered by one station at a time
- Make the four buttons from Exercise 5 functional so that the trains are filtered by one or more buttons at a time
- Bonus: Conditional rendering for when there are no trains to display
